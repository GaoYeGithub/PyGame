# Forest Cat's Adventure - Part 1: Exploration and Battle

Welcome to Cat's Adventure, an exciting journey where you guide a brave cat exploring a mysterious world filled with danger and adventure. 
So far I only created a complete the basic parallax map, camera controls, and basic projectiles and goblins enemies.
I'm hoping to improve my skill and improve/fix many of the mechanics!

## Features in Part 1

- **Basic Map:** Explore forest map with different elements of a page move at different speeds creating a 3D depth effect
- **Camera System:** A smooth camera follows the player's movement, offering a clear view of the surroundings (Three version made Border, Auto, and Follow.)
- **Player Controls:** Guide the cat through the world using intuitive movement and action controls.
- **Basic Attack Mechanic:** Attack and defeat goblin enemies with projectiles!
- **Enemies:** Face off against goblins with health bar that roam the map.


How to Play
Movement: Use arrow keys or WASD to move the cat across the map.
Attack: Press the spacebar to throw projectiles.
